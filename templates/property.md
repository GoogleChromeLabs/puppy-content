// NOTE: MDN editors try to keep sentence structures consistent across reference

// Please follow the examples in this template and in the links provided. Don't get
// creative.

// Please do the following:
// 1. Replace all [[tokens]] with the specified information. Be sure to remove
// the brackets.
// 2. Answer all questions in comments.
// 3. Remove all comments.

## Description

// Complete the sentence below with a basic description of the propertyt.
// You may add more sentences if needed.

// If this is not a read-only property, delete 'read-only' from the sentence below.

// requires that developer-defined identifiers be in Italics.

// Remove the second line if this is a read-only property.

`var _varName_ = [[InterfaceName]].[[PropertyName]]`
`[[InterfaceName]].[[PropertyName]] = _varName_`

### Value

// Replace '[[Type]]' with the return type.

A [[Type]].

## Examples

// Provide one or more code examples showing the use of the property.
// Code samples from explainers or specs often work well for this.
// When creatting the examples, keep the following in mind:

// _ Each example should only illustrate one aspect of the interface's use.
// _ If you provide only one example, delete the subheadings.
// \* You may reuse examples from the parent interface page, if they're
// appropriate.

// Note: code examples are not applications. If you have never created a code
// example before you may skip this section, but you are incouraged to ask
// for help instead. If you skip this section, please delete it.

// Replace this title with a descriptive one.

### Example

The following example shows

```js
//
```

// Replace this title with a descriptive one.

### Example

// Example for a boolean property.

// Most booleans can be illustrated as simply as the boilerplate below.
// You only need to provide more detail or a more complicated example if
// the result expresses something more subtle.

The following example shows

```js
if ([[InterfaceInstance]].[[PropertyName]]) {
  console.log([[Something relevant]]);
}
```
