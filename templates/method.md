// NOTE: MDN editors try to keep sentence structures consistent across reference
// documents. This makes scanning for information easier and more predictiable.
// Please follow the examples in this template and in the links provided. Don't get
// creative.

// Please do the following:
// 1. Replace all [[tokens]] with the specified information. Be sure to remove
// the brackets.
// 2. Answer all questions in comments.
// 3. Remove all comments.

## Description

// Complete the sentence below with a verb followed by a basic description of the method.
// You may add more sentences if needed.

## Syntax

// Delete the version that does not apply.

`[[InterfaceName]].[[MethodName]]()`

`var Promise = [[InterfaceName]].[[MethodName]]()`

### Parameters

// Replace this section with 'None.' if this method has no arguments. Use a
// consistent grammatical structure throughout. Noun phrases (ex: "A boolean that
// indicates...") and sentences starting with verbs are prefered. This is not a
// school essay. Sentence fragments are the correct approach for definitions.

<dl>
  // Repeat for each parameter
  <dt><em>Parameter</em></dt>
  <dd>Definition</dd>
  <dt><em>Name</em></dt>
  <dd>A string identifying the item to be added.</dd>
</dl>

### Return value

// Delete the version that does not apply.

Returns a [[ReturnType]].

Returns a Promise that resolves with [[ResolveType]].

### Exceptions

// Delete this section and its heading if no exceptions are thrown by this
// method. Use a consistent grammatical structure throughout. Noun phrases and
// sentences starting with verbs are prefered. This is not a school essay. Sentence
// fragments are the correct approach for definitions.

<dl>
  // Repeat for each exception
  <dt><code>ErrorName</code></dt>
  <dd>Definition</dd>
  <dt><code>TypeError</code></dt>
  <dd>Thrown when invalid data is passed in the `name` argument.</dd>
</dl>

## Examples

// Provide one or more code examples showing the use of the method.
// Code samples from explainers or specs often work well for this.
// When creatting the examples, keep the following in mind:

// _ Each example should only illustrate one aspect of the interface's use.
// _ If you provide only one example, delete the subheadings.
// \* You may reuse examples from the parent interface page, if they're
// appropriate.

// Note: code examples are not applications. If you have never created a code
// example before you may skip this section, but you are incouraged to ask
// for help instead. If you skip this section, please delete it.

// Replace this title with a descriptive one.
