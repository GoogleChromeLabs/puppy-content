## Description

The `contextrestored` [`EventHandler`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Events/Event_handlers) of [Canvas Api](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Canvas_API)
is triggered when the user agent "restores" the backing storage associated with
'CanvasRenderingContext2D' on the page after being "lost".

Once the context is restored, the resources such as drawings that were created before
the context was lost are no longer valid. You need to reinitialize the state of your 
context and recreate resources.

## Examples

const canvas = document.getElementById('canvas');
const ctx = canvas.getContext('2d');

canvas.addEventListener('contextrestored', (event) => {
  console.log(event);
});

// If this context ctx is lost, this context will then be restored automatically. 
// The event "contextRestored" will be logged in the console.
